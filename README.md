# Rock-Paper-Scissors
My first JavaScript project:
This basic rock-paper-scissors game runs in the console
only at this time.

UPDATE: 3/13/24
Replaced alerts and logs with DOM methods: 
User interface was added. 
User can now play game with labeled buttons.
Game keeps track of score and displays final winner in page.
